minisat4j eases the use of Minisat from Java programs. Minisat is used by
calling the configured executable, writing some text to its standard input and
reading the output once it's completed.

The configuration file solver.cfg must be present but may be empty. Currently
only two options are recognized:

solver.executable - this denotes the name of the executable of minisat. Some
distributions choose other names than minisat (e.g. Ubuntu Linux uses minsat2).

verbose - can only be true or false. If this option is set to true the solver
prints every constraint that gets passed to minisat on stdout. It is recommended
to only turn this option on when dealing with small constraint systems.
